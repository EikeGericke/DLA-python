# DLA
Diffusion Limited Aggregation

A python project for my Scientific Computing module at university, produces fractals in 2D/3D for further analysis.

## Current Features
- 2D Fractal
  * Fractal Dimension
  * Radial Density Function
- 3D Fractal
  * Fractal Dimension (Incorrect)
- Border Growth (2D)
- Fractal Growth Animation
- Different Seeds
